Simple interest is money you either earn or have to pay when withdrawing or adding a priniciple amount.  For #, the prinicple amount is $#.  To calculate the interest in x time, you have to know the APR or interest rate.  In this case, it is 4%.  The default equation is, y=loan(APR)*x | (x is time).  To plug in the numbers, you first have to substitute loan for the tuition amount which is #, the APR which is 4% (convert it into decimal by dividing by 100), and x which is unknown.The completed equation will be y = #(0.04)*x

Compound interest is money you usually have to pay when withdrawing a loan from a private institution or bank.  Unlike simple interest, compound interest grow exponentially.  To calculate the interest in x time, you have to know the APR or interest rate.  In this case, it is 5.8%.  The default equation is y=loan(APR+1)^x | x is time.  To plug in the numbers, you first have to substitute loan for the tuition amount which is #, the APR which is 5.8% (convert by dividing by 100), and x which is unkown (years).  The completed equation will be y = #(1.58)^x
